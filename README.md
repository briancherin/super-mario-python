I am attempting to create a version of Super Mario where the character's movement is controlled by the varying volume of microphone input. For example, the player would need to make a continuous hum/sound to move the character forward, and to jump, the player would have to produce a sharp spike in volume. 


# Super Mario Implementation in Python

This is inspired by Meth-Meth-Method's: https://github.com/meth-meth-method/super-mario/

## Running

* $ pip install pygame scipy
* $ python main.py

## Standalone windows build

* $ pip install py2exe
* $ python compile.py py2exe

## Controls

* Left: Move left  
* Right: Move right  
* Space: Jump  
* Shift: Boost   
* Left/Right Mouseclick: secret
